# Introduction to Statistical Learning by Harvard (edX)

I completed the **Introduction to Statistical Learning** course by Harvard through edX. This course covered foundational and advanced topics in statistical learning, including:

- **Supervised Learning**: Regression, Classification, LDA, k-NN, Ridge, Lasso.
- **Unsupervised Learning**: PCA, Clustering.
- **Model Selection and Evaluation**: Cross-Validation, Bootstrapping.
- **Tree-based Methods**: Decision Trees, Bagging, Boosting.
- **Advanced Topics**: Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), Deep Learning.
